### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Samia, an aspiring software developer with a passion for programming and innovation. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring my love for design and art, diving into a good book, or shooting hoops on the basketball court. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions and constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
Let's connect and collaborate to build something amazing together! ðŸš€
